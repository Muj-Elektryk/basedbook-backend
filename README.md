An innovative educational social platform backend.

Have you ever thought of a social platform, which combines your school's online gradebook, friends and communities? If you have, the answer for you is **BasedBook**.

# Why BasedBook?
## BasedBook is and forever will be open-source under GPL v3 License

BasedBook's openess means that if you don't like something about it you can propose a change. If you have some TypeScript skills, you can even submit a Pull Request. It means that users of our social platform have fine control over the development of BasedBook.

## BasedBook uses modern and easy to understand technology

BasedBook is written in modern NestJS framework and TypeScript, which insures type safety. Code is clean and easy to understand, so as to make developers' lives easier.

## BasedBook respects your privacy

BasedBook in contrast to other popular social platforms stores only data that it really needs. You don't need to worry about Meta or other company spying on you.

## BasedBook has modular design

Our social platform is designed to be modular. Backend API is separated from frontend, which means if you don't like our UI, you can always write your own frontend in your favourite framework.

## BasedBook is made by users for users

BasedBook's creators are just regular users of other social platforms, which means that we understand the needs of regular people.

## BasedBook ties your local communities together

BasedBook lets you share your ideas and projects with other people in your school, village, town or city.
